I’m excited to share my Django-based web application project titled “Job Portal.” This platform allows job seekers to register, browse, and apply for jobs, while employers can post listings and manage applications. Admins have control over both users and job postings. The project uses Python with Django for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. It is fully functional and deployed using Render.com, with all dependencies and setup steps included in the documentation. I’ve attached a PDF with a detailed overview and have also shared the GitHub repository link for your review. I’d be grateful for any feedback or suggestions.
